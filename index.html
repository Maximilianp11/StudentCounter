                <p>
                    Bananas are grown in 135 different countries around the
                    world with the largest producers of bananas being China
                    and India who together account for approximately 26% of
                    global Banana production. Bananas are also a staple food
                    in many of the tropical regions on earth, like how in
                    Africa, plantains and bananas provide more than 25
                    percent of the caloric requirements for over 70 million 
                    people.

                <p>
                    There are many different species of bananas, but they all
                    fall into 1 of 2 categories, cooking bananas called
                    plantains, and dessert bananas. Plantains are very
                    starchy and are not meant to be eaten raw and are supposed
                    to be cooked before eating. Plantains are a staple food in many of
                    the tropical regions on earth and are used similarly to how
                    we use potatoes in the US. Dessert bananas on the other
                    hand are the bananas you would find at the grocery store and
                    you can just eat them without having to cook them at all and
                    are generally more flavorful than plantains. Bananas belonging to 
                    the cavendish group are the most widespread species of banana and
                    dominate the global banana market.

            <ul>
                <li>Bananas are a non-seasonal crop and are therefore available year round</li>
                <li>Banana fruits develop from a banana heart which has around 9 tiers and each tier sprouts about 20 bananas, so a fully developed 
                    heart can weigh up to 143 lbs</li>

                <li>Bananas are picked when they are green (unripe) and are transported to the desination country and are then ripened in special 
                    airtight rooms filled with ethylene gas which help induce ripening.</li>
                <li>Bananas were orginally from Southeast Asia and were brought to South America and later Africa by european traders/explorers</li>
                <li>A green banana can be placed in a paper bag with an apple or tomato to speed up the ripening process</li>
